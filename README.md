# Circular Sector

A set of functions computing cartesian coordinates, describing circular and annular sectors.

Usable for drawing circular things on ex. `svg` and `canvas` elements, but not bound to either of them.

Great for circular visualisations like spread, progress and reticulated splines. No dependencies.
